In this era of social fashion, trends are changing every moment. People love to wear designer clothes worn by their favourite celebrity.
However, as the craze for the latest fashion clothes increases, the price of such apparel increases in direct proportion. “RentHvn” allows the users to rent an attire of their choice for a given period.The ability to select various attires to suit the occasion provides an economical option to the users. 
Moreover, they can also donate their old clothes to registered NGOs. Hence, this helps us to explore a market that promises a great future.
